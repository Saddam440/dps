<h1 style="margin-bottom: 11px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:24px;"><span style="line-height:107%"><b>INVESTING FROM BALANCE.</b></span></span></span></h1>

<p style="margin-bottom: 11px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%">Trade Modules have daily accounting &amp; display daily interest just like a Bank CD (Certificate of Deposit), however they are a 135 Earning Days Contract and all earnings from this matures at the end of the Contract just like a Bank CD, which at that time, those funds in your Account eWallet can be used to reinvest by purchasing new Trade Modules.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 11px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%">Our company executives want our members and leaders to know that this issue and subject in passive investment programs, ad packs &amp; ad share platforms, etc is one of the major factors in those companies not being able to stand the test of time, because that company&#39;s ability to meet its future interest return obligations, become exponential and uncalculable and when unmanageable and ultimately unsustainable &amp; unreachable. We know that by making the Trade Module operate as a fixed contract, it does do as nearly all other similar programs are touting and presenting as a great feature, however, operating this way provides DeepProfitStreams program with the ability to effectively forecast, and the ability to confidently promote the stability &amp; reliability of the daily trading profits returns being offered on the site.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 11px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%">One final point. Your Account eWallet balance actually has two parts. One part is Funds that you may load to the Account before making a Trading Module purchase, and the other is daily interest accumulation toward the completion of the Contract. Loaded funds portion can be used at any time. Daily interest accumulation toward the completion of the Trade Module can be reinvested or purchase new Trade Modules with that portion, upon Contract completion. Our company executives have already decided that these two eWallet balances should be separated, but it is not a simple quick thing to do because of all the internal places the full eWallet balance is used, and the Tech Dept has many other more vital tasks at this time, however, they will get to it in 1st Quarter 2020.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 11px; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%">Due to the fact that these two eWallet balances are not separated at this time, combined with the length of time for the 135 days contract to be completed, therefore, as a benefit to our members who will or may forget or lose track of time, and so that valuable earning days are not lost when the contract is completed, there will automatically be created a new Trade Module contract for the member at the end of the 135 days period unless the Member contacts Support indicating they prefer this function to be turned off and not performed. However, when the programming is done and completed to separate the two eWallet balances, from that point forward, the member will be responsible to be aware of, and keep track of, and manually create a new Trade Module earnings contract(s) on their own in order to keep from losing interest earning days.</span></span></span></p>

<br />
3. Summary of comprehensive refund policy&nbsp;<br />
<br />
These are two reasons, among others, that we cannot and therefore we do not provide refunds, other than as specifically stated for only certain limited time offers and/or specifically marked items:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One: Nearly 100% of our products are immediately available and downloadable digital products, recorded trainings, etc and therefore cannot be returned to us or &quot;undownloaded&quot;, &quot;unwatched&quot;, or &quot;unlearned&quot;.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Two: The moment the/your transaction is processed, we paid instant commissions to the referring affiliate as well as additional Bonus commissions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is considered a significant violation of our terms and conditions, for anyone to place a dispute or request a refund with ANY of our Payment Processors, and if that occurs, your account will immediately be terminated without recourse or pre-warning. &nbsp;This would also cause the removal and deletion of any pending or listed earnings, bonuses, overrides, etc from the account or accounts involved.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Therefore, purchaser/you must, and accept(s) full responsibility to, carefully consider the products and/or services offered prior to being selected for purchase.&nbsp;<br />
